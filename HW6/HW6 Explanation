we first sort the array and initialize a list to hold all of the possible triplets
we then have a for loop that iterates through all the elements in nums
inside the for loop we check to see if the new element we are checking is the same as the previous one, and if it is then we skip it
initialize left and right as two pointers converging to the center
have a while loop where left is less than right and will stop when that statement isn't true
next we check to see if the current number added with the left index and right index is 0
if the number is too great, we can decrement the index of the right side to make the total smaller
similarly, if the number is too small, we can increment the index on the left side to make the total larger
if neither are true, we have a triplet equal to 0 so we add it to the list of triplets and we also increment the left side to continue looking for possible triplets
we also have a while loop that will keep incrementing the left until we get to a unique element, or else there is possibility for a duplicate triplet
finally we return the list of triplets
