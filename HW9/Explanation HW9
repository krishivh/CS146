First step is to have a base case where p or q is checked as the root, because if it is, that means that you can just return the root as the LCA assuming that both of the nodes are in the tree.  

Next we check two things. 

The first is if poth p and q are less than the current node meaning that they will both be on the left side, and we can return the left side as the next node. 

The other thing is if p and q are greater than the current node than we will be on the right side.  

If neither of these steps are true, that means that we know that both p and q are on opposite sides of the current node, and that means that we can just return the current node as the LCA, assuming that p and q exist in the tree.
