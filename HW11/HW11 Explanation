first we check to see if the image exists and if it doesn't have a row or column length then it will just return a blank image back
we then have a base case if the original color and the new color is the same then just return the image
next we can use the helper function to fill the 2d array
after the helper function has finished, we can finally return the 2d array after the recursion is complete

for the helper function we use the same parameters and in addition to that we have one for the original color of the pixel
next we check if all of the parameters are valid, and even if one of the parameters doesn't fit the charactersitic, then we return out of the recursive call
After the if statemenet is checked, if it moves on that means that the pixel is valid for being changed and we can change it to the new color
finally we can recursively call all of the pixels adjacent to the current pixel for those to be changed as well if they meet the correct charactersitics.
