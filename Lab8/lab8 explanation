initalize an array with amount+1 coins and the reason is if we need to use pennies only we still have enough to create amount
fill the entire array with amount+1 as the value and as we test out possibilities for amount that will be updates
make the minimum amount of coins for an amount 0 to be 0
iterate through each coin in coins
iterate through each amount starting from the value of the coin
calculate the minimum number of coins needed for current amount
check if the amount is less than or equal to and if it is then erturn minCoin[amount]
return -1 if there is no possible combination
