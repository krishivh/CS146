We first define the starting and ending parameters 
We have a while loop so as long as the first parameter is less than the second we keep going through index
We then check if the first index is a letter or digit and if it isnt then we skip past it in the index. We do the same thing with the last index
We then finally check if the first index and last index are equal and if they are not we can just return false
if they are equal then we add one to the increment the first index and decrement the last index
This loop continues and if the while loop finishes successfully, True is returned
